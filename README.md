# Bayesian Random Writer

**This is a work in progress.  While the code works, the text in this document may be outdated with respect to the current state of the codebase.**

This project examines source text, splits that text into a sequence of tokens (generally words, but can be letters).

Then, a tree is built which describes how likely a token is to occur given that it occurs after another token, and so on, an arbitrary number of tokens deep.

Then, the tree is used to generate novel text given a seed token.  If no seed token is provided, one is generated using a statistical profile of token usage in the source text.

In the future, the writing style may be improved using more sophisticated statistical methods, i.e. Bayesian inference.  This is not yet implemented, and currently only uses the statistics taken direclty from the source material.

# Installation

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/wbrickner/BayesianRandomWriter
```

A recent version of Node.js is required (tested with `v11.6.0`).

# Usage

```shell
$ ./index.js -v                  display version
             -w [--windowsize]   consecutive words to consider when building statistical profile
             -s [--seedword]     first word in the generated text
             -l --length         length of text to generate
             -m --memory         quantity of memory to allocate in MB
             
             <SourceFile.txt>    text file to analyze
```

## Example

Let's generate 100 words, mimicking the writing style of Donald Trump's tweets, while giving the process 8GB of memory:

```shell
$ ./index.js -w 12 -l 100 -m 8192 ./sources/25k-trump-tweets.txt
```

This provides the (interesting) output:

```

# Performance Considerations
The inefficiencies of this program can become serious. Optimizations may be made in the future, it depends how much time I have. 

Storing the statistical profile (an enormous tree) consumes a lot of memory.  Use the `-m [MB]` flag to allocate more memory to the underlying node process.  If not enough is available, decrease the window size (`-w [WindowSize]`).
